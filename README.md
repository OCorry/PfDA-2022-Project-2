# Introduction

This repository contains the second project required for Module *Programming for Data Analysis* as part of the H. Dip in Computer Programming and Data Analysis course at <a href="https://www.gmit.ie" target="_top">Atlantic Technological University, Galway</a>
 



# Setup of the Environment

Firstly, I set up the relevant programming environment by installing relevant packages to my machine:

- Python (Anaconda) - Installing the full Anaconda version of Python as Anaconda has the libraries already installed

- Jupyter Notebook - Platform on which I ran Python to carry out my project

-	Cmder - to Navigate through directories and to open Jupyter notebook within the required Directory
  - As I am using a Windows machine, Cmder is a more user friendly command line than the Windows Command Prompt


In <a href="https://github.com/" target="_top">github</a>, I set up my repository titled **PfDA-2022-Project-2** in my Github account and cloned my project repository to my machine. I did this by clicking the green **Code** box and copying the HTTPS link. Then back in Cmder command line, using the the ``git clone command`` followed by the copied HTTPS link and hitting return, I saved my repository in my preferred folder on my own machine. 


When creating my repository in Github, I left it public so that my work could be accessed publically. I made sure that my repository contained a README.md file.
Once the repository was successfully cloned to my machine I opened Jupyter Notebook in the repository using the ``Jupyter Notebook`` command in Cmder. This opens Jupyter Notebook as a local browser.
From here, I set up a Notebook by clicking 'new' Python 3(ipykernel) and named the Notebook *PfDA-2022-Project-2. This saved in Jupyter Notebook as a ``.ipynb`` file.


Using the ``git add .``, ``git commit -m" "`` and ``git push`` commands in Cmder, I have pushed up my updated work to GitHub as frequently as possible.
